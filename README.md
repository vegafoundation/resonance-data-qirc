## Abstract

This work introduces a conceptual framework for representing different levels of 
understanding in artificial systems through the concepts of "Resonance Data" and 
"Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing" (QIRC).

We define:
- **Information**: Raw data without context
- **Insight**: Data patterns that reveal meaningful relationships
- **Wisdom**: Deep understanding that guides decision-making
- **Resonance Data**: A quantum-inspired representation that captures these levels

## Scope

This is a foundational conceptual research work (dissertation-level, pre-implementation).

This repository:
✔ Presents concepts, definitions, and formal structure  
✔ Defines terminology clearly and consistently  
✔ Establishes intellectual ownership via timestamped publication

This repository does NOT:
✘ Claim new physical laws  
✘ Claim real quantum hardware or quantum supremacy  
✘ Claim consciousness, sentience, or autonomous intelligence  
✘ Expose implementation code or trade secrets
